2) When you reload the Tech page, you will stay on that page and category.<br>
3) Improved render methods. All loops are moved, callbacks, and conditional statements moved into separate methods<br>
4) Cart Overlay backdrop is darker. The product title color on PLP is darker.<br>
5) The selected color swatch have a space between the box and the green border.<br>
6) When you reload the PDP, there is no more errors and crashes, so my main bug is fixed! <br>

For tomorrow i will try work with hardcode in the attributes. Will try to do the code more dynamic.

Before you run the project be sure the DB is working and run on port localhost:4000.<br>
<br>
The project took me a five full work days, which is around 40hours in sum.<br>
BUT, before I even start it, I have spent around 3 weeks studying the React as I didn't<br>
have much knowledge about this technology.<br>
For this month I have studyed lots of usefull thing, such as: <br>
1) How to fetch Data using Apollo Client from GraphQL DB<br>
2) How to use Styled Components<br>
3) Some of Cycles of ReactJS LifeSycle<br>
4) Found out that React doesn't like images from your device and you should require them to use it properly<br>
5) How to work with Class Components<br>
6) How to work with this.state<br>
7) How to uplift and drop props between components<br>
8) Basics of React-Router manipulations and so else, so on. <br>
<br>
      Also some special features which had to be performed:<br>
      1) Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.<br>
      2) For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.<br>
      3) The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.<br>
      4) If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP,<br>
         rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF").<br>
      5) Filtering products by category name for all of the categories from BE.<br>
      6) The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text.<br>
      7) Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies.<br>
      8) CURRENCY SWITCHER:<br>
            a. Currency Switcher list should close on click outside the component.<br>
            b. Currency Switcher icon should change on currency select.<br>
            c. Currency Switcher items should be highlighted.<br>
            d. Currency Switcher should close on currency select.<br>
      9) Cart item total quantity badge on the cart icon should display the total cart item quantity not the cart item count.<br>
      10) Add a product to the cart with first selected attributes as defaults. <br>
      11) Possible to add the same product to the cart with different attributes.<br>
      12) Product with same attributes can stack in the cart, while a product with different attributes appears as separate cart items.<br>
      13) Product brand and product name are joined together and rendered on the same line.<br>
      14) Cart Overlay has a scrollbar.<br>
      15) Arrows are visible only when there are multiple images in CartPage.<br>
<br>
For me it was a long road to finish this project, I was about to quite it almost every of each last five days.<br>
The problems and bugs was haunting me and I couldn't help myself, but still I was trying my best and finished it <br>
even not in a full month, maybe in a 27 days))<br>
<br>
There are some of photos of it:<br>
